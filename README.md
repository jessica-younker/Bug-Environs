# Bug-Environs
Web application using Augluar and DjangoREST Framework with ElasticSearch and Kibana built over two weeks for my backend capstone project at Nashville Software School.

## To use:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Then visit the following urls at your leisure. If using docker-machine, replace localhost with your container's ip.

Web application: http://localhost:8080

Django REST API: http://localhost:8000

Kibana: http://localhost:5601

Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200
