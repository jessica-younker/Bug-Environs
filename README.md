# Bug-Environs
Web application using Augluar and DjangoREST Framework with ElasticSearch built over two weeks for my backend capstone project at Nashville Software School.

## To use:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Then visit the following urls at your leisure. If using docker-machine, replace localhost with your container's ip.

Web application (served by nginx): http://localhost:8080

Kibana: http://localhost:8000

Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200
